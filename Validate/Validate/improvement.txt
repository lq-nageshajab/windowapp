Against burn in excel 
1. IsRestartPeriodically should always be set to “Y”.
2. proxies are set to Y or not

Against scrape maintenance sheet
1. compare scrape url from scrape maintenance sheet with VWR url
2. scrape start name should match with that from scrape maintenance

Check csv output file
1. posting Url length should not be greater than 450


//Misc
I noticed that IsNoProxies is set to Y and the scrape is set to run with RestartMethod = EntireProcess, so I set it back to the default values of IsNoProxies = N, RestartMethod = WebBrowser and RestartInterval  = 20

//DONOTUSE
I noticed if TotalJobs_DONOTUSE element is present in the scrape in that case it should not show error for TotalJobs
as 'Reqiured element TotalJobs not found' in this case only one element will be present at time.
